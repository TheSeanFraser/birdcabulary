		<h1>Birdcabulary</h1>
		<div id="text_wrapper">
			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>This is currently a work in progress - I am working on filling out the sound database to include songs and calls for all bird species found in Ontario.</p>
			<p>All sounds are sourced from <a href="https://xeno-canto.org/">xeno-canto.org</a>.</p>

			<h3>Bird Packs</h3>
			<p>Selecting a bird pack will play sounds for a variety of birds, not just one family. For example, the Hawk Hill Flyover Pack includes birds that are known to fly over Hawk Hill in Toronto during the hawk watch season. It is intended to be used as a study tool to practice identifying those species in flight.</p>

			<h3>Future Features</h3>
			<p>Planned features: "Real Life" mode (adding extra bird/environment noise to emulate the real life sound ID experience), and using similar sounding species to fill the multiple choice options instead of only selecting other members of a family.</p>
			<p>Other ideas for this project include a better scorekeeping system, adding hints or descriptions of sounds to help with learning, expanding to all of North America/rest of the world. (psst, Cornell Lab of Ornithology, I'm available...)</p>
