			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>This is currently a work in progress - I am working on filling out the sound database to include songs and calls for all bird species found in Ontario.</p>
			<p>All sounds are sourced from <a href="https://xeno-canto.org/">xeno-canto.org</a>.</p>
			<h3>Bird Packs</h3>
			<p>Selecting a bird pack will play sounds for a variety of birds, not just one family. For example, the Hawk Hill Flyover Pack includes birds that are known to fly over Hawk Hill in Toronto during the hawk watch season. It is intended to be used as a study tool to practice identifying those species in flight.</p>
